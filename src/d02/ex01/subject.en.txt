well played, you helped the small elf to count his apples
but you still see the small elf, further away, stil count apples by hand
you realise that deeper in the magical farm,
there are special rows of magical tree

you shall create the function `special_sum`
with the prototype:
```c
unsigned int	special_sum(unsigned int tree);
```

the special row of trees work as follow:
if the total of trees is even, the number of apple works like regular row

but if the total of trees is odd, every even tree is skipped in the sum

if `tree` = 4:
sum(4) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

if `tree` = 5:
sum(5) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9

ðŸ’¡ tip: look at `%` (called modulo) operator

good luck :3
