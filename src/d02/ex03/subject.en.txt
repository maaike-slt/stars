you're the best, now the elf has all the time in the world

he tells you that with that time, he will get to know the ponies 🐎
and maybe make friend with them,
all of that will start by remembering their name

by asking the ponies, the small elf realise that they have pony names
that are hard to remember for him

you suggest to the small elf to remember only the first letter of each name
that way, there is way less information to remember

the small elf thank you again
he is happy to see that even with his bad memory he will be able
to remember information about the ponies

you decide to help him a bit more by creating a function
that will return the first letter of a pony name

💡 you will learn about the concept of:
	`string`, `array`, `char *` and maybe even `pointer`

you shall create the function `first_letter`
with the prototype:
```c
char	first_letter(char *pony_name);
```

if `pony_name` = "Parthenia":
first_letter("Parthenia") = 'P'

if `pony_name` = "Spurgeon":
first_letter("Spurgeon") = 'S'

💡 you don't have to handle empty string,
	as you won't encounter any empty names
	e.g. first_letter("")

good luck :3
