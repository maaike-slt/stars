a small elf need to count the number of apples in it's magical farm
every day he needs to do the same thing over and over again

would you accept to help him
by creating a function that count apples for him?

‚ö†Ô∏è this exercise step up the difficulty
but if you succeed the next exercise
will have a way smaller difficulty step !!

you shall create the function `sum`
with the prototype:
```c
unsigned int	sum(unsigned int tree);
```

in the elf's magical farm, the trees are magic and produce apples a weird way

for a row of trees, a tree will produce apples + 1 of the tree on it's left

in other words:
this function need to return the sum of all numbers
from 0 to number of tree `tree`

if `tree` = 3:
sum(3) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

if `tree` = 5:
sum(5) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

üí° tip: look at `while` loop

good luck :3
