a small elf need to count the number of apple in it's magical farm
every day he need to do the same thing over and over again

would you accept to help him
by creating a function that count apple for him?

‚ö†Ô∏è this exercise step up the difficulty
but if you succeed the next exercise
will have a way smaller difficulty step !!

you shall create the function `sum`
with the prototype:
```c
unsigned int	sum(unsigned int tree);
```

in the elf magical farm, the tree are magic and produce apple a weird way

for a row of tree, a tree will produce apple + 1 of the tree on it's left

in other words:
this function need to return the sum of all number
from 0 to number of tree `tree`

if `tree` = 3:
sum(3) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

if `tree` = 5:
sum(5) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

üí° tip: look at `while` loop

good luck :3
