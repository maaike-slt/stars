file to turn in:		name_len.c
forbidden functions:	strlen

the small elf is very happy to be able to connect with the ponies 🐎

but you start to realise something
some ponies have the same first letter for their name

you start to think how you could still differenciate the names easily
all of a suddent, you have an idea, what if the small elf
only has to remember, the first letter of the name, and it's length

you talk about it to the smal elf, and he jump of happiness

you goal is clear, create a function `name_len` !


💡 search what is a `size_t`

you shall create the function `name_len`
with the prototype:
```c
size_t	name_len(char *pony_name);
```

if `pony_name` = "Parthenia":
name_len("Parthenia") = 9

if `pony_name` = "Ab":
name_len("Ab") = 2

💡 you don't have to handle empty string,
	as you won't encounter any empty names
	e.g. name_len("")

good luck :3
