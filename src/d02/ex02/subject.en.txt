perfect, now the small elf don't need to count every apple every day!

he thank you a lot and invite you to his barn
as you come him, you see some very cute ponies üêé
the small elf explains to you that he harvest the apple to feed the ponies
the elf doesn't own the ponies, there are wild ponies that he likes to feed

he also tells you that
everyday there are a different amount of ponies
and the small elf count the amount of apples everyday
to know if he has enough apples to feed all the ponies

you realise that you can help the small elf again
you just made a function to count the number of apples

üí° you will need to learn about `bool` and `#include`

you shall create the function `can_feed`
with the prototype:
```c
bool	can_feed(unsigned int tree, unsigned int pony);
```

the file can_feed already exist

you do not need to re-code the function `special_sum`
it is availible to be used/call in the file by doing:
```c
int tree;
int answer;

tree = 42;
answer = special_sum(tree);
```

the goal of the function `can_feed`
is to return `true` if the number of `tree` can produce more apples
than the number of `pony`

if `tree` = 3
	&& `pony` = 5:
can_feed(3, 5) = (
	special_sum(3) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 4
	4 < 5
) = false

if `tree` = 3
	&& `pony` = 2:
can_feed(3, 2) = (
	special_sum(3) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 4
	4 > 2
) = true


if `tree` = 3
	&& `pony` = 4:
can_feed(3, 2) = (
	special_sum(3) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 4
	4 == 4
) = true

good luck :3
