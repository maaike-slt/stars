file to turn in:		ft_strcpy.c
allowed functions:		None

all the animals seems to be fixed, you did a great job

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'Good! Very good!
   The tornado destroyed quite some trees and plant.
   We should replant them with the magic of C.
   You are gonna make a plant-copytator!'

you shall create the function `ft_strcpy`
with the prototype:
```c
char	*ft_strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);
```

this function need to reproduce the behavior of the function `strcpy`

💡🐇 this time, you won't have explanation on what the function does
     you will need to ask people and check `man strcpy`

good luck :3
