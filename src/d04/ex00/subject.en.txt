you are on the floating island with the magical bunny 🐇

the magical bunny 🐇 looks at you and says:
- 'We need to prepare you for what is to come!
   Let's start by making everything 42, that's always the answer'

you shall create the function `the_answer`
with the prototype:
```c
void	the_answer(uint8_t *ptr);
```

this function give you a pointer to a `uint8_t`
you need to change the `uint8_t` it's pointing to, to 42

if `n` = 0:
the_answer(&n);
`n` == 42

if `n` = 81:
the_answer(&n);
`n` == 42

if `n` = 42:
the_answer(&n);
`n` == 42

good luck :3
