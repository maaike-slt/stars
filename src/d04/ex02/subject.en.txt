file to turn in:		ft_putstr.c
allowed functions:		write

all the animals seems to be fixed, you did a great job

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'Very nice job!
   Let's rest a bit and just look at the landscape.
   Can you tell me what you see?'

you shall create the function `ft_putstr`
with the prototype:
```c
ssize_t	ft_putstr(const char *str);
```

this function gonna print/write the string `str` to the console
it shall return the size of what has been printed, and -1 in case of error

💡🐇 `man 2 write` gives:
     RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes written is returned.
	   On error, -1 is returned

ft_putstr("hello");
prints `hello` and return 5

ft_putstr("");
prints nothing and return 0

good luck :3
