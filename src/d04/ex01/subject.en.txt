the tornado calms down

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'You did a great job.
   There is a lot more to do. starting by fixing those animals'

the magical bunny 🐇 points to a fox 🦊 with wings and some kind of fluffy bat 🦇?

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'The animals here have been affected by all the chaos
   This fox 🦊 has butterfly 🦋 wings,
   which means that some butterfly 🦋 lost them.
   And this animal is half bat 🦇 half squirrel 🐿️,
   which means that somewhere there is a half squirrel 🐿️ half bat 🦇.
   You need to give back the butterfly 🦋 wings
   to the poor wingless butterfly 🦋.
   And fix those other chimera.'

you shall create the function `swap`
with the prototype:
```c
void	swap(int *a, int *b);
```

this function gives you two pointer
you need to swap their value

if `a` = 42 and `b` = 21:
swap(&a, &b);
`a` == 21 and `b` = 42;

if `a` = 21 and `b` = 42;
swap(&a, &b);
`a` == 42 and `b` = 21;

if `a` = 0 and `b` = 0;
swap(&a, &b);
`a` == 0 and `b` = 0;

if `a` = 42 and `b` = 42;
swap(&a, &b);
`a` == 42 and `b` = 42;

good luck :3
