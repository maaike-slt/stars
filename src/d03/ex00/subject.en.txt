a few meters into the woods, you stumble upon a magical bunny 🐇

the magical bunny 🐇 look at you and says:
- 'I saw you helping the small elf, I am quite impressed.
   I think you have quite a gift with the ues of the ancient art of C programing.
   You see, I have dedicated most of my life learning the art of C,
   and I would like to have you as my student!'

you had some trouble following what the magical bunny 🐇 was saying,
as you were quite distracted by how cute the magical bunny 🐇 is
after you find your concentration back, you get all excited and say yes

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'Good, for this first exercise, I will give you a word, and a letter,
   and you will need to find the letter in the word
   and tell me where it is'

you shall create the function `find_char`
with the prototype:
```c
ssize_t	find_char(char *word, char letter);
```

💡 search what is a `size_t`

if `pony_name` = "Parthenia":
name_len("Parthenia") = 9

if `pony_name` = "Ab":
name_len("Ab") = 2

💡 you don't have to handle empty string,
	as you won't encounter any empty names
	e.g. name_len("")

good luck :3
