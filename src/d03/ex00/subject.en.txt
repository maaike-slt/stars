a few meters into the woods, you stumble upon a magical bunny 🐇

the magical bunny 🐇 look at you and says:
- 'I saw you helping the small elf, I am quite impressed.
   I think you have quite a gift with the ues of the ancient art of C programing.
   You see, I have dedicated most of my life learning the art of C,
   and I would like to have you as my student!'

you had some trouble following what the magical bunny 🐇 was saying,
as you were quite distracted by how cute the magical bunny 🐇 is
after you find your concentration back, you get all excited and say yes

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'Good, for this first exercise, I will give you a word, and a letter,
   and you will need to find the letter in the word
   and tell me where it is'

right after the bunny finish talking, you start to see a bunch of words
comming from deep in the forest
as they come at you, leaves from the trees start to fall
you start to feel attacked by the leaves and decide to code to defend yourself

you shall create the function `find_char`
with the prototype:
```c
size_t	find_char(char *word, char letter);
```

this function will return the `index` of the char `word[index]` == `letter

if `word` = "hello" and `letter` = 'e':
find_char("hello", 'e') = 1

if `word` = "world" and `letter` = 'w':
find_char("world", 'w') = 0

💡 you don't have to handle:
	- `letter` found multiple times
		( find_char("banana", 'a') )
	- `letter` not found
		( find_char("banana", 'e') )
	- `word` is empty
		( find_char("", 'a') )

good luck :3
