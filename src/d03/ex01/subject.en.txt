file to turn in:		find_char.c
forbidden functions:	all stdlib functions

the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'Very good, you start to understand the magic of C.
   I would like you to do the same, but this time,
   I am gonna throw a bunch of shit at you.
   Your goal will be not to have your program explode 💥 impressivingly'

you shall create the function `find_char`
with the prototype:
```c
ssize_t	find_char(char *word, char letter);
```

💡🐇 a `ssize_t` (defined in `sys/types.h`) is a `signed size_t`
     which mean that it can go negative
     it is useful when a function can return an error, then it can return -1
	 for example: `write` returns an `ssize_t`
	 it usualy returns the size of what it wrote
	 but will return -1 in case of error

this function will return the `index` of the first `word[index]` == `letter`

if `word` = "hello" and `letter` = 'e':
find_char("hello", 'e') = 1

if `word` = "world" and `letter` = 'w':
find_char("world", 'w') = 0

in case of 2+ char found, return the first one:
if `word` = "banana" and `letter` = 'n':
find_char("banana", 'n') = 2

in case of 0 char found, return -1
if `word` = "banana" and `letter` = 'e':
find_char("banana", 'e') = -1

in case of empty word, return -1
if `word` = "" and `letter` = 'a':
find_char("", 'a') = -1

good luck :3
