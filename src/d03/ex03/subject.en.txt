the magical bunny 🐇 says:
- 'Good, now let's see if you can count better.
   Do you see those ducks 🦆 in the lake?
   You will have to tell me every hour
   if there are more ducks 🦆 than the last hour'

you see the cute duck 🦆 in the lake
they are very cute :3

you shall create the function `more_duck`
with the prototype:
```c
size_t	more_duck(uint8_t *duck, size_t size);
```

this function takes an `array` and its `size` in input
the `array` `uint8_t *duck` holds the number of ducks per hour:
 - `duck[0]` number of ducks at hour 0
 - `duck[1]` number of ducks at hour 1
 ...
it shall return how many times `duck[n]` > `duck[n - 1]`

if `duck` = [3, 5, 3, 4]
	and `size` = 4:
uint8_t	duck[] = {3, 5, 3, 4};
more_duck(duck, 4) = 2

     	               more:
hour:	0   1   2   3
duck:   3   5   3   4
     	3 < 5          true  (+1)
     	    5 > 3      false (+0)
			    3 < 4  true  (+1)
     	                     (=2)

if `duck` = [4, 4, 5, 6]
	and `size` = 4:
uint8_t	duck[] = {4, 4, 5, 6};
more_duck(duck, 4) = 2

     	               more:
hour:	0   1   2   3
duck:	4   4   5   6
     	4 = 4          false (+0)
     	    4 < 5      true  (+1)
			    5 < 6  true  (+1)
     	                     (=2)

if `duck` = []
	and `size` = 0:
uint8_t	duck[];
more_duck(duck, 0) = 0

if `duck` = [42]
	and `size` = 1:
uint8_t	duck[] = {42};
more_duck(duck, 1) = 0

good luck :3
