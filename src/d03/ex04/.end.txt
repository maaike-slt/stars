the magical bunny 🐇 says:
'You passed my test!
 You see, all of this little exercise were a test
 to see if you were actually worthy of being my student.

 We will soon start to fight actual threat!
 Be prepared as we are gonna attack pointers!!!!'

as the magical bunny 🐇 finishes talking,
you feel the ground trumble
it feels like an earthquake!
you start to see birds flying away
but then, weirdly, the birds are going down?

you realise that a piece of the forest
you are in just detached from the ground and is now levitating!!!

remember `ls -la`
