‚ö†Ô∏è this exercise step up the difficulty
but if you succeed the next exercise
the next exercise will have a way smaller difficulty step !!

you shall create the function `sum`
with the prototype:
```c
unsigned int	big(unsigned int n);
```

this function need to return the sum of all number from 0 to `n`

if `n` = 3:
sum(3) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

if `n` = 5:
sum(5) = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

üí° tip: look at `while` loop

good luck :3
